# NekoUI

Do you know the borrrinnggg old OneUI, and Moto Launcher, always with borrring app icons and themes? Well. No longer are you trapped by your phone manufactures. Unless your phone is an iPhone. Then good luck. Yes. That's right, NekoUI is only for Android. RIGHT NOW! It may (depending if it's possible/I can be bothered) be available for iOS. More likely IPadOS if I'm being honest with you. 


Stay tuned for all the fun I'll have with this <3
